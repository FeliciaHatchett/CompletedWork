Conclusions:
Music, Theater, and Film and Video, saw the most consistent success with a higher percentage of successful to failed or cancelled projects (with 79%, 61%, and 58% success respectively), with all journalism projects ending as ‘canceled’.
Overall, Kickstarter projects launched in May tend to be more successful than projects launched in any other month. This may be due to the temporal proximity to tax refunds or distance from other holidays such as Christmas/Hanukkah which are generally associated with an increase in extraneous spending. To that effect, December is shown to be the least successful month to launch a Kickstarter project as the only month in which failed projects outnumber successful endeavors. 
Kickstarter projects originating in the US account for roughly 75% of all projects, and the platform saw a sizable jump in total number of projects between 2013 and 2014 (going from a total of 274 projects in 2013 to 976 projects in 2014). 2014 also saw the first year in which the overall number of failed campaigns outnumbered that of successful campaigns in any month.
Limitations:
Limitations to the data were that the population being marketed to, the breadth of marketing and/or advertising to solicit donors, and the types of rewards/incentives offered per donor level were not provided. 
Other Possibilities:
Some additional tables/graphs to consider would be the correlation between the window of time the Kickstarter projects were live and their rate of success to see if there is a sweet spot for successful campaigns. Additionally, it may be interesting to look at the success rate by country as well as by amount requested (goal).
